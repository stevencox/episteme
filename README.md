# Episteme

This module is a preliminary exploration of methods for building knowledge bases using big data techniques

In particular, we use Apache Spark running on a Mesos cluster to analyze PubMed Medline and PubMed Central medical journal articles.

This initial work develops a basic framework on top of Spark for loading and processing articles in a variety of ways.
